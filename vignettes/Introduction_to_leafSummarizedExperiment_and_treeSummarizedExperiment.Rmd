# Introduction 

The `leafSummarizedExperiment` and `treeSummarizedExperiment` classes are both
extensions of the `SummarizedExperiment` class. They are used to store
rectangular data of experimental results as in a `SummarizedExperiment`, and
also support the storage of a hierarchical structure and its link information to
the rectangular data. The `leafSummarizedExperiment` is intended to store
experimental data and annotation information for the leaf nodes of a tree, while
the `treeSummarizedExperiment` class contains experimental (or derived) data and
annotation information also for the internal nodes of the tree.

# The leafSummarizedExperiment class

## The comparision between leafSummarizedExperiment and SummarizedExperiment

The `leafSummarizedExperiment` class has exactly the same structure as the
`SummarizedExperiment` class, including `assays`, `rowData`, `colData` and
`metadata`. More details about the `SummarizedExperiment` structure can be found
in [SummarizedExperiment for coordinating experimental assays, samples, and
regions of
interest](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html).
The difference to `SummarizedExperiment` is that `leafSummarizedExperiment` has
more restrictions on the data. 

* It requires a `phylo` object stored in `metadata` and named `tree`.
* It requires that the `phylo` object has a unique label for each leaf node.
* It requires a column `nodeLab` in `rowData`, or row names of `rowData`, to
provide the label of the node that each row is mapped to.

The link between the `assays` data and the nodes of the tree strucutre is
checked when the `leafSummarizedExperiment` object is build. Only rows that
could be mapped to the nodes of the tree are kept in the matrix-like
elements of `assays`.

## The construction of leafSummarizedExperiment

We generate a *toyTable* with observations of 5 entities collected from 4
samples.
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(treeAGG)
    library(S4Vectors)})

# assays data
set.seed(1)
toyTable <- matrix(rnbinom(20, size = 1, mu = 10), nrow = 5)
colnames(toyTable) <- paste(rep(LETTERS[1:2], each = 2), 
                            rep(1:2, 2), sep = "_")
rownames(toyTable) <- paste("entity", seq_len(5), sep = "")

toyTable
```

Descriptions of the `r nrow(toyTable)` entities and `r ncol(toyTable)`
samples are given in the *rowInf* and *colInf*, respectively.
```{r}
# row data
rowInf <- DataFrame(var1 = sample(letters[1:2], 5, replace = TRUE),
                    var2 = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5, replace = TRUE),
                    row.names = rownames(toyTable))
rowInf

# column data
colInf <- DataFrame(gg = c(1, 2, 3, 3),
                    group = rep(LETTERS[1:2], each = 2), 
                    row.names = colnames(toyTable))
colInf
```

The hierarchical structure of the 5 entities is denoted as *toyTree*. We create
it by using the function `rtree` from the package `r CRANpkg("ape")`. It's a
`phylo` object.
```{r}
# create a toy tree
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ape))
toyTree <- rtree(5)
class(toyTree)
```

As we see, the `phylo` object is actually a list of four elements.
```{r}
str(toyTree)
plot(toyTree)
```

To store the toy data, *toyTable*, *rowInf*, *colInf*, and *toyTree*, we could
use a `leafSummarizedExperiment` container. The map between the rows of
*toyTable* and the leaf nodes of *toyTree* is checked when creating a
`leafSummarizedExperiment` object. If the object is built as below, we get a
message that 5 rows of *toyTable* are removed because they can't be matched to
any node of the tree. The `assays` table of the resulting *test1* object
consequently has no rows.
```{r}
# use the toy data to create a leafSummarizedExperiment object.
test1 <- leafSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable), rowData = rowInf,
                                  colData = colInf, tree = toyTree)
assays(test1)[[1]]
```

To correctly store data, we need to additionally provide the link information
between the rows of *toyTable* and the nodes of the *toyTree* via a column
`nodeLab` in `rowData` or via the row names of `rowData`.

Option 1: Create a `leafSummarizedExperiment` object by changing the row names
of `rowData`.
```{r}
# change the row names of the row data
rowInf_1 <- rowInf
rownames(rowInf_1) <- toyTree$tip.label
toyTable_1 <- toyTable
rownames(toyTable_1) <- toyTree$tip.label
test2 <- leafSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable_1), 
                                   rowData = rowInf_1,
                                   colData = colInf, 
                                   tree = toyTree)
assays(test2)[[1]]
```

Option 2: Create a `leafSummarizedExperiment` object by adding a column
`nodeLab` to the `rowData`.
```{r}
# add a column (nodeLab) to the row data
rowInf$nodeLab <- toyTree$tip.label
lse <- leafSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                rowData = rowInf,
                                colData = colInf,
                                tree = toyTree)
assays(lse)[[1]]
```

Although the `leafSummarizedExperiment` object could be sucessfully created in
either way, the row names of the table in `assays` are different. We recommend
to do it as option 2 because it keeps the original row names and works better
especially when there are multiple rows mapped to a same leaf node of the tree.


The `leafSummarizedExperiment` only supports data on the level of the leaf
nodes. If users have rows mapped to internal nodes of a tree, then the
`treeSummarizedExperiment` class should be used instead. Technically, the
`treeSummarizedExperiment` could also store data on the level of leaf nodes.
Users could choose either `leafSummarizedExperiment` or
`treeSummarizedExperiment` to store data on the level of leaf node as shown in
Section \@ref(sec:tse-build)).

# treeSummarizedExperiment {#tse-class}

## Anatomy of treeSummarizedExperiment

```{r strTSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "The structure of the treeSummarizedExperiment class."}
knitr::include_graphics("tse.png")
```
Compared with the `SummarizedExperiment` class, there are two more slots, the
tree data (`treeData`) and the link data (`linkData`), in the
`treeSummarizedExperiment` class. Other slots, including `assays`, `rowData`,
`colData` and `metadata`, are the same as those in `SummarizedExperiment`.

Here, we construct a `treeSummarizedExperiment` object using the toy example
from the previous section. With the function `nodeValue`, data at all nodes of
the tree is created based on the available data on the leaf node level. The
argument `fun` specifies how the value at an internal node is calculated from
its descendant nodes. Here, the sum is used, and thus the value for each node is
equal to the sum of the values of all its descendants. To view the running
process, `message = TRUE` is used.

```{r}
tse <- nodeValue(data = lse, fun = sum, message = TRUE)
```

The output *tse* is a `treeSummarizedExperiment` object. The class
`treeSummarizedExperiment` is an extension of the `SummarizedExperiment` class.
```{r}
class(tse)
showClass("treeSummarizedExperiment")
```

As shown, there are two more slots, treeData and linkData, in
`treeSummarizedExperiment` compared with `SummarizedExperiment`.
```{r}
tse
```

### Assays
To extract a table in `assays` from `treeSummarizedExperiment` object, we could
use the `assays` accessor function. This is similar to the
`SummarizedExperiment` class.

```{r}
(aData <- assays(tse)[[1]])
```

We could use the node labels from the link data (\@ref(sec:linkData)) as the row
names via the argument `use.nodeLab = TRUE`. Commonly, the column `nodeLab` is
used as the row names. However, if it has duplicated values, the column
`nodeLab_alias` is used.

```{r}
assays(tse, use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[1]] 
```

The value at each node (from sample *A_1*) could be visualized with the
following figure. We see that the value at each internal node is the sum of
those at its descendant leaves.  More details about how to use 
`r Biocpkg("ggtree")` to plot the tree could be seen
[here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html).
```{r}
# load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(dplyr)   # to use rename in the creation of datF
    library(ggtree)  # to plot the tree
    })

# extract a sample column from assays 
ex1 <- assays(tse)[[1]][, 1, drop = FALSE]

# combine it with the data extracted from linkData
# rename column nodeNum as node
datF <- cbind.data.frame(ex1, linkData(tse)) %>% rename(node=nodeNum)

# plot
ggtree(treeData(tse)) %<+% datF +
  geom_text2(aes(label = A_1), color = "brown1", size = 8)
```

The data *datF* is used to annotate the tree via `%<+%` (see `?"%<+%")

### Row data 

The row data could be accessed with `rowData()`. We provide an additional
argument `internal` to specify whether the internal part of the row data should
be displayed. See *new_tseM* in the vignette *Example of data analysis* as an
example. The result tables obtained from `r Biocpkg("edgeR")` are named as
`result_assay1` and stored as a column of the `rowData`. It's the internal part
of the row data and is visible with `internal = TRUE`. The internal data is
generated by functions, such as, `runEdgeR` or `updateTSE`, and is designed to
store the analysis results of the tables from `assays`. Users are not allowed to
change them. Here, as *tse* doesn't have internal row data, we get exactly the
same result.
```{r}
rData.1 <- rowData(tse, internal = FALSE)
rData.2 <- rowData(tse, internal = TRUE)
all.equal(rData.1, rData.2)
```

The column `nodeLab` isn't in the `rowData` (neither *rData.1* nor *rData.2*)
because it is moved to the `linkData` (see Section \@ref(sec:linkData)).
```{r}
rData.1
```

### Column data and metadata

The column data and metadata could be accessed exactly as in the
`SummarizedExperiment` class.
```{r}
(cData <- colData(tse))
```

```{r}
# It is empty in the metadata
(mData <- metadata(tse))
```

### Link data {#sec:linkData}

The `linkData()` accessor is used to view the link information between rows of
matrix-like elements in the `assays` and nodes of the tree. 
```{r}
(linkD <- linkData(tse))
```
Rows of the link data are one-to-one mapped to rows of the matrix-like element
in `assays`, and they are exactly in the same order. The column *rowID* contains 
the row number. Each row of the matrix-like element in `assays` could be mapped
to a node of the tree, whose label and number are in the column *nodeLab* and
*nodeNum*, respectively. The column *isLeaf* gives information whether a node is
a leaf node. 

If the labels of internal nodes are available and unique on the tree, the link
data would have 4 columns including *nodeLab*, *nodeNum*, *isTip*, and *rowID*;
otherwise, it would have one additonal column *nodeLab_alias*.

As shown in the Figure \@ref(fig:toyTREE), the tree we have used has no labels 
(orange text) for internal nodes.

### Tree data

The tree structure could be accessed using `treeData()`. It is a `phylo` object. 
```{r}
treeD <- treeData(tse)
class(treeD)
```

The figure of the tree structure is shown in the Figure \@ref(fig:toyTREE). The
node label is given in orange text, and the node number is in blue.
```{r toyTREE, fig.cap="Rectangular layout of toyTree."}
ggtree(treeD) + 
    geom_text2(aes(label = label), color = "darkorange", 
               hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.7, size = 6) +
    geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue", 
               hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.7, size = 5)
```

## Constructing a treeSummarizedExperiment {#sec:tse-build}

A `treeSummarizedExperiment` object could be constructed using the
function `treeSummarizedExperiment`.

```{r}
tseA <- treeSummarizedExperiment(tree = treeD, linkData = linkD, 
                                 assays = list(aData), 
                                 rowData = rData.1,
                                 colData = cData, 
                                 metadata = mData)
```

If the provided tree has a unique label for each node, we could also construct a
`treeSummarizedExperiment` without providing the link data.

We recreate a tree *treeN* based on the old tree by adding labels to the
internal nodes.
```{r}
treeN <- treeD
treeN$node.label <- paste("Node_", 6:9, sep = "")
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:newTREE), we see that all nodes have different labels in 
orange text. 
```{r newTREE, fig.cap="Rectangular layout of the new tree treeN."}
# plot
ggtree(treeN) + 
    geom_text2(aes(label = label), color = "darkorange", 
               hjust = -0.05, vjust = -0.4, size = 6) +
    geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue", 
               hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.7, size = 5)
```

We would need to provide the mapping information between rows and nodes of the
tree if the link data is not given in the creation of a
`treeSummarizedExperiment` object. This could be done by adding a `nodeLab`
column to the row data. Users need to make sure they have assigned a correct
label to a row.
```{r}
# give a column nodeLab in row data
# the linkData is created automatically
lab <- ifelse(is.na(linkD$nodeLab), linkD$nodeLab_alias, linkD$nodeLab)
lab
(nData <- cbind(nodeLab = lab, rData.1))
```

Create *tseB* without providing the link data.
```{r}
tseB <- treeSummarizedExperiment(tree = treeN, 
                                 assays = list(aData),
                                 rowData = nData,
                                 colData = cData, 
                                 metadata = mData)
```

The link data has been generated automatically and has only four columns as
described in Section \@ref(sec:linkData).
```{r}
linkData(tseB)
```


As users like, data on the level of leaf nodes could be organized as a
`leafSummarizedExperiment` object (*lseC*) or a `treeSummarizedExperiment`
object (*tseC*) as below. 
```{r eval= FALSE}
lseC <- leafSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                 rowData = rowInf,
                                 colData = colInf,
                                 tree = toyTree)
```

```{r}
tseC <- treeSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                 rowData = rowInf,
                                 colData = colInf, 
                                 tree = toyTree)
```
