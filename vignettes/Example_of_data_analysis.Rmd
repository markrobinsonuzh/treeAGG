# Introduction

The arrangement of hypotheses in a hierarchical structure appears in many
research fields and often indicates different resolutions at which data can be
viewed and results can be interpreted. Examples include studies of microbial
abundance where the OTUs (operational taxonomic units, often assumed to
represent species) can be arranged as leaves in a phylogenetic tree, and
single-cell studies where the individual cells can be organized hierarchically
in increasingly comprehensive clusters, e.g. via hierarchical clustering. In
both these examples, a question arises on which resolution level the signal in
the data (e.g. differential abundance of features between groups) is best
interpreted, or put in another way, on what resolution the main 'driver' of the
signal can be found. For example, in the microbial abundance data, a whole
family of species may react similarly to a particular stimulus. In such
situations, it would be more informative to summarize the differential abundance
analysis on this level of resolution, rather than providing a long list of
individual differentially abundant OTUs. An additional reason for aggregating
data to higher levels of the phylogenetic tree is that the abundances of
individual species or OTUs may be low, limiting the power of the statistical
test to pick up any significant differences, whereas by aggregating the signal
from multiple related OTUs, the detection power can be increased. For the
single-cell data example, similarly, if a treatment truly acts on a high level,
affecting the abundance of, e.g., all B-cells, it is helpful if this is picked
up by the analysis pipeline, rather than returning a large number of
significantly differentially abundant subclusters of the main B-cell cluster.
The `r Biocpkg("treeAGG")` package is designed to analyze data that can be
organized in a hierarchical structure, and to find the most informative
resolution at which to interpret the signal of interest.

# Methods {#flowchart}

## The main structure of the pipeline provided in `r Biocpkg("treeAGG")`
```{r flowchart, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "The workflow of treeAGG package."}
knitr::include_graphics("Flowchart.png")
```

In the `r Biocpkg("treeAGG")` package, we provide a easy-to-use pipeline (Figure
\@ref(fig:flowchart)) to perform statistical tests for each leaf and internal
node of a hierarchical structure, and finally aggregate the results to find the
most informative resolution for interpretation. The starting point for the
analysis is a hierarchical structure (e.g., a phylogenetic tree), a data matrix
with values for all leaves in this hierarchical structure, and annotation tables
for rows and columns of the matrix. From here, users can follow the standard
five steps outlined in Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart) to derive data values for
each internal node, perform a statistical test for each node, and aggregate the
results of these tests to find an optimal resolution for interpretation.
Alternatively, the extended data matrix can be extracted for customized
analysis, the results of which can be integrated back into the `r
Biocpkg("treeAGG")` pipeline for aggregation. The table extracted after step 2
has more rows than the original table because it includes data for entities
corresponding to the internal nodes of the tree. In each step, we have listed
the available functions to do it in blue texts. The details about each steps are
summarized below.

* Step 1: Data preparation. Store data on the level of leaf nodes in a
`leafSummarizedExperiment` container. More details about the construction of a
`leafSummarizedExperiment` object could be found in the [Introduction to
leafSummarizedExperiment and treeSummarizedExperiment](Introduction to
leafSummarizedExperiment and treeSummarizedExperiment_copy.Rmd).

* Step 2: Data preparation. Derive data on the level of internal nodes and store
data on all nodes in a `treeSummarizedExperiment` container. More details about
the construction of a `treeSummarizedExperiment` object could be found in the
[Introduction to leafSummarizedExperiment and
treeSummarizedExperiment](Introduction to leafSummarizedExperiment and
treeSummarizedExperiment_copy.Rmd).

* Step 3: Data analysis. Users could use the available wrapper function
`runEdgeR` in our package or other suitable software to do customized analysis.
Test individual hypotheses at tree leaves and internal nodes simultaneously and
use the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure to control the FDR. Nominal and adjusted
p-values for each node are required to do tree aggregation.

* Step 4: Tree aggregation. Start from the leaf nodes of the tree. Compare
p-values on leaf nodes to that on their parent node. If the minimum value is on
the parent node, take the parent node; otherwise, take the leaf nodes and
compare them to nodes on a higher level. Here, we refer the root node as the
highest level. Repeat the comparison until you reach the root. Check the nodes
finally left and keep only those where the null hypothesis is rejected.

We suggest users to come back to this workflow (Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart))
after they read Section \@ref(analysis) and Section \@ref(aggregation).

## Theoretical example

Here, we shown the example of using `r Biocpkg("edgeR")` to perform the
individual statistical tests on each leaf and internal node, to explain how this
pipeline works. Users are free to choose any suitable package or software to do
the analysis. Consider the case in which a table and a hierarchical structure of
$n$ entities (e.g. microbial species or cell types) are available. In this
table, each row represents an entity $g$, and each column a sample. Samples are
collected from subjects with different phenotypic outcome (e.g., healthy and
diseased). Let $Y_{gi}$ denote the observed value of an entity (corresponding to
a node on the tree) $g$ in sample $i$. As assumed in `r Biocpkg("edgeR")`
[@Robinson2009], $Y_{gi}$ follows a negative binomial distribution

$$\mathbf{Y}_{gi}  \sim NB(\mathbf{M}_{i}\mathbf{p}_{gj}, \mathbf{\phi}_{g})  $$
$$g = 1, 2, 3, ..., n, n+1, ..., n+K;$$ 
$$i = 1, 2, ... m;$$ 
$$j = 1, 2, ..., J.$$


Here,  $\mathbf{M}_{i}$ is the effective total count of sample $i$,
$\mathbf{p}_{gj}$ is the relative abundance of entity $g$ with phenotypic
outcome $j$ to which sample $i$ belongs, and $\mathbf{\phi}_{g}$ is the
dispersion parameter used to model the biological variation between samples. The
negative binomial distribution is parameterized with mean as
$\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{Y}_{gi}] = \mu_{gi} =  \mathbf{M}_{i}\mathbf{p}_{gj}$, and
variance as $\text{Var}[\mathbf{Y}_{gi}] = \mu_{gi}(1+\mu_{gi}\phi_{g})$. When
$\mathbf{\phi}_{g} = 0$, the negative binomial distribution reduces to Poisson
distribution. In total, we have $n+K$ entities, $m$ samples and $J$ conditions.
Among $n+K$ entities, $1, 2, ..., n$ correspond to the leaf nodes of the tree,
and the other $K$ entities to the internal nodes. In most cases, only the former
could be observed and data analysis is hence often performed only on the level
of leaf nodes. Here, we suggest to derive data for the internal nodes based on
the leaves and further perform analysis on all nodes of the tree. This could
make it possible to do the association investigation on all levels of the tree
structure. Users can choose any reasonable method to generate data for the
entities corresponding to internal nodes, based on the observed values for the
leaves. Here, we create the abundance of an internal node by summing the
abundance of its descendant leaf nodes.


With the data ready, we could firstly estimate the the value of
$\mathbf{\phi}_{g}$ and build a generalized linear model at each node of the
tree.

$$
\text{log}(\mu_{gi}) = \mathbf{x}^{T}_{i} \mathbf{\beta}_{g}, \quad 
g = 1, 2, ..., n, n+1, ...., n+K
$$
where $\mathbf{x}^{T}_{i}$ is a vector of covariates including confounders
(e.g., age, gender) and the covariate of interest (e.g., diseased and healthy
sample) applied on sample $i$, and $\mathbf{\beta}_{g}$ is a vector of
corresponding regression coefficients. Let $\beta^{1}_{g}$ denote the
coefficient value for the covariate of interest in $\beta_{g}$. We then arrange
the hypotheses in a tree-like structure and test hypotheses to get a p-value at
each node.
$$
H^{g}_{0}: \beta^{1}_{g} = 0 \quad  (g = 1, 2, ..., n, n+1, ...., n+K ),
$$
where $n$ is the number of leaf nodes and $K$ is the number of internal nodes.

Multiple testing correction methods, such as the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure,
could be applied here to decide whether the null hypothesis at a node should be
rejected.

It's likely that an internal node found to be significantly associated with the
phenotypic outcome is due to some of its descendant nodes. In other words, only
some of its descendant nodes are phenotypic outcome associated and this signal
is not diluted enough by other descendant nodes that are not phenotypic outcome
associated. In the tree aggregation step, we aim to pinpoint the nodes that
drive the association.

To do tree aggregation, we need the p-value derived from the analysis above at
each node. The algorithm starts from the leaf nodes of the tree.

1. Compare the p-values on the leaf nodes with those on their respective parent
node. If the minimum value is on the parent node, select the parent node;
otherwise, select the leaf nodes.
2. Compare the selected nodes to nodes on a higher level as previous step. Here,
we refer the root node as the highest level.
3. Repeat the comparison until you reach the root. 
4. Check the nodes finally left and keep only those whose null hypotheses are
rejected.

# Data preparation

Load the packages below before the start of analysis.  
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(treeAGG)
  library(edgeR)
  library(S4Vectors)
  library(ggtree)
})
```
The data analysis includes two steps. One is to do the hypothesis test (for
example, differential abundance (DA) or differential state (DS) test) on each
node, the other is to combine these results with the tree structure to do tree
aggregation. The `r Biocpkg("treeAGG")` package provides functions to do the
second step, and users are free to perform their testing using any suitable
software. Here, as an example, we show the DA test step performed with the 
`r Biocpkg("edgeR")` package. `r Biocpkg("S4Vectors")` might be required in the
data preparation step to create `DataFrame` objects.

A count table and a tree structure are required to do data analysis. If the tree
structure is not a `phylo` object, we need to convert it via `as.phylo` from 
`r CRANpkg("ape")`.

```{r}
# count table
data("cytofCount")
count <- DataFrame(cytofCount)

# tree structure
data("cytofTree")
class(cytofTree)

# convert to the phylo class
library(ape)
Tree <- as.phylo(cytofTree)

```


The information of each cell cluster, corresponding to a row in the count table,
is given in the `cytofCluster` (see `?cytofCluster` for more details).

```{r}
# row information 
# add a column called nodeLab to tell which node a row corresponds to.
data("cytofCluster")
cytofCluster <- DataFrame(cytofCluster)
cytofCluster$nodeLab <- cytofCluster$cluster
```

We add a new column named as `nodeLab` to tell which node of the tree a row of
the count table corresponds to. If such a column is not given, the rownames of
the `cytofCluster` is used for the mapping. Hence, users should be careful about
the `nodeLab` column or the rownames, and make sure they use the same label as
the node label of the tree. When the `nodeLab` column and the rownames both
exist and are different, the `nodeLab` column is used.

The information of each sample, corresponding to a column in the count table, is
given in the `cytofSample` (see `?cytofSample` for more details).

```{r}
# provide sample information: from healthy or CN group
data("cytofSample")
```

We could organize the above data into a `leafSummarizedExperiment` object via
the  `leafSummarizedExperiment` constructor function. See details about the
class `leafSummarizedExperiment` (`?'leafSummarizedExperiment-class'`) and its
constructor.
```{r}
# construct a leafSummarizedExperiment object to include tree structure, count,
# cluster information and sample information
lse <- leafSummarizedExperiment(tree = Tree,
                                assays = list(count),
                                rowData = cytofCluster,
                                colData = cytofSample)
class(lse)
showClass("leafSummarizedExperiment")
lse
```

The output *lse* is a `leafSummarizedExperiment` object. It has the same
structure as a `SummarizedExperiment` object. The abundance table of clusters is
stored as a matrix-like element in `assays`. The cluster information is stored
as `rowData` and the sample information as `colData`. The hierarchical structure
of cell clusters is stored in `metadata`.

The abundance table in *lse* only provides the counts (abundances) of clusters
at tree leaf level. We are interested to do a differential abundance test at
different hierarchical levels of the tree,  and aim to find the optimal level in
the tree to intepret the association between the differental abundance of
clusters and the phenotypic outcome (here, CN and healthy). Hence, we also need
the abundance of internal nodes that represent different hierarchical level of
the tree and indicate different resolutions at which data can be viewed. We
generate counts of internal nodes by summing the counts of their descendants,
using the `nodeValue` function as shown below.

```{r}
tse <- nodeValue(data = lse, fun = sum, message = TRUE)
class(tse)
```

There are more rows in the count table stored in `assays` of *tse* than *lse*.
These new generated rows corresponds to the internal nodes of the tree.
```{r}
dim(assays(lse)[[1]])
dim(assays(tse)[[1]])
```

The `rowData` dimension changes coordinately. 
```{r}
dim(rowData(lse))
dim(rowData(tse))
```
How to access the elements of `leafSummarizedExperiment` and
`treeSummarizedExperiment` could be found in the vignette [Introduction to
leafSummarizedExperiment and treeSummarizedExperiment](Introduction to
leafSummarizedExperiment and treeSummarizedExperiment_copy.Rmd).

The information of a cluster (an internal node) is decided by its descendant
leaves. Here, for example, the column *truth* provides the information whether a
cluster is truly differentially abundant. The cluster, which corresponds to an
internal node of a tree, would have value `TRUE` in the *truth* column if all
its descendant clusters have *truth* and have value `NA` in *truth* column if
its descendant clusters have different values for *truth*.
```{r}
# select a cluster that corresponds to an internal node of the tree and has TRUE
# in the 'truth' column
sel <- which(rowData(tse)$truth & !linkData(tse)$isLeaf)[1]
rowData(tse)[sel, ]

# find the descendant clusters (nodes) of the selected cluster
desd <- findOS(tree = treeData(tse), ancestor = linkData(tse)$nodeNum[sel], 
               only.Tip = TRUE, return = "number")
# The descendants all have TRUE in the 'truth' column
rowData(tse)[match(desd, linkData(tse)$nodeNum), ]

```


# Differential abundance analysis {#analysis}
## Analysis on a single table

In a `treeSummarizedExperiment` object, multiple tables can be stored as
`assays`. Users could choose to perform analysis on one of them or on multiple
assays simultaneously. We start to show you how to do it on a single table.

Users are free to choose suitable R packages to run DA test. Here, as an
example, the analysis with `r Biocpkg("edgeR")` is shown. There are two options
to do it.

* Option 1: use functions from `r Biocpkg("edgeR")`. This is more flexible and
allows more customized settings.

* Option 2: use the function `runEdgeR` from `r Biocpkg("treeAGG")`. It's a
wrapper using functions from `r Biocpkg("edgeR")`.

### Option 1: Use `r Biocpkg("edgeR")` {#option1}

Extract the count table to do data analysis. To make sure we know which row
corresponds to which node of the tree, we need to use `use.nodeLab = TRUE`. It
might lead to errors in the tree aggregation step if users forget to set
`use.nodeLab = TRUE`.
```{r}
# extract the abundance table
count <- assays(tse, use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[1]]
```

Then, we follow the routine steps of using the `r Biocpkg("edgeR")` package to
perform differential abundance analysis as below.
```{r}
# calculate total count for each sample
# The total count is the sum of cell counts of clusters on the leaf level of the
# tree.
tip_tse <- tse[linkData(tse)$isLeaf, ]
tipCount <- assays(tip_tse, use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[1]]
libSize <- apply(tipCount, 2, sum)

# create DGEList
y <- DGEList(counts = count, lib.size = libSize,
             remove.zeros = FALSE)

# calculate normalisation factors
y <- calcNormFactors(object = y, method = "TMM")

# construct design matrix
sample_inf <- colData(tse)
design <- model.matrix(~ subject + group, data = sample_inf)

# estimate dispersion
y <- estimateGLMRobustDisp(y, design = design)

# fit the negative binomial GLMs
fit <- glmFit(y, design = design, prior.count = 0.125)

# run likelihood ratio tests 
# contrast is not specified here, so the last coefficient is tested.
lrt <- glmLRT(fit, contrast = NULL)

# Use Benjamin-Hochberg method to do multiple testing correction
# n is set to Inf below, because we want to have the results of all entities.
out <- topTags(lrt, n = Inf, adjust.method = "BH")$table
head(out)
```
The output *out* has five columns, one of which is the nominal p-value
(*PValue*) and one is the adjusted p-value named *FDR*. These columns are
required by the tree aggregation step. If users choose other softwares to do
analysis, we expect they could finally get results similar to *out* with columns
containing nominal and adjusted p-values and each row representing a node of the
tree structure. We could further store the result in the `rowData` of *tse* via
the function `updateTSE`.

```{r}
# put *out* in a list. 
outList <- list(assay1 = list(out))
new_tse1 <- updateTSE(result = outList, tse = tse, 
                      use.assays = 1, design = design, contrast = NULL, 
                      fit = fit)
```
The result *out* is changed to a list object *outList* before it is assigned to
the argument `result`. The reason to do it could be seen later in the section ??
where analysis on multiple tables with multiple contrasts are performed. Give
the name of the data container, *tse*,  where the results will be stored. Tell
the function which tables of `assays` in *tse* have been used to get the
analysis result *out* by using `use.assays`. Give the design matrix and
contrasts that have been used in the analysis via `design` and `contrast`, and
these would be stored in the `metadata` of the new `treeSummarizedExperiment`
object *new_tse1*. Users could optionally store the result *fit* created before
by the `glmFit` function for later use, for example, to quickly get new result
when specifying a new contrast.

```{r}
rowData(new_tse1)
```
We see that there is a new column called *result_assay1* that stores the result
*out*.
```{r}
rowData(new_tse1)$result_assay1
```

If users want to see only the original row data, it could be achieved by
specifying `internal = FALSE`.
```{r}
rowData(new_tse1, internal = FALSE)
```


### Option 2: Wrapper function

In the package `r Biocpkg("treeAGG")`, we have provided a wrapper function to do
the work of section \@ref(option1) in one step.

```{r}
new_tse2 <- runEdgeR(obj = tse, use.assays = 1, design = NULL, 
                 contrast = NULL, normalize = TRUE, method = "TMM", 
                 adjust.method = "BH")
new_tse2
```
The prepared data *tse* is assigned to the `obj` argument. If there are more
than one matrix-like elements in the `assays`, we could use `use.assays` to
select which elements will be used for analysis. Here, the first matrix-like
element will be used as `use.assays = 1`. Users could customize the design
matrix and contrasts via `design` and `contrast`, respectively, and they will be
saved in the `metadata` of the output for later check. If they are not given,
the wrapper function will by default use `colData` to generate a design matrix
and test the last coefficient in the `glmLRT` step.

## Analysis on multiple tables with multiple contrasts

Here, we will show how to perform analysis simultaneously on multiple tables.

We create a new `treeSummarizedExperiment` object *tseM* with 3 tables in the
assay. It is the same to the *tse* except the part of `assays`.
```{r}
# extract the abundace table
count <- assays(tse, use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[1]]
# new treeSummarizedExperiment with three tables in the assays
tseM <- treeSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(count, (2*count), (3*count) ),
                                 tree = treeData(tse), 
                                 linkData = linkData(tse),
                                 rowData = rowData(tse),
                                 colData = colData(tse))
```

Assume we want to analyze the first and the third tables. This could be done in
one step. We feed *tseM* to the `obj`, tell R to use the first and third tables
by setting `use.assays = c(1, 3)`, and specify the design and contrasts via
`design` and `contrast`. Then, we get the analysis results updated in the
`rowData` of *new_tseM*.
```{r}
new_tseM <- runEdgeR(obj = tseM, use.assays = c(1, 3), design = NULL, 
                     contrast = list(contrast1 = NULL, 
                                     contrast2 = c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0)),
                     normalize = TRUE, method = "TMM", 
                     adjust.method = "BH")
new_tseM
```
We could see that there are now 7 columns in the rowData. The 2 new columns are
the analysis results from the first and third tables of `assays`,
*result_assay1*, and *result_assay3*. These two columns are referred as the
internal part of the `rowData` that are only visible with `internal = TRUE` when
`rowData()` is used to access the row data. We don't recommend users to access
or modify these columns as they are required for the tree aggregation step. 

If users want to do some customized settings that are not provided above, they
could extract the target tables and follow the work in section \@ref(option1)
and finally integrate the results into *tseM* using the function `updateTSE` as
below.

```{r}
count1 <- assays(tseM, use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[1]]
count3 <- assays(tseM, use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[3]]


# calculate library size
count1.t <- assays(tseM[linkData(tseM)$isLeaf, ], use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[1]]
count3.t <- assays(tseM[linkData(tseM)$isLeaf, ], use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[3]]
libSize1 <- apply(count1.t, 2, sum)
libSize3 <- apply(count3.t, 2, sum)

# create DGEList
y1 <- DGEList(counts = count1, lib.size = libSize1, remove.zeros = FALSE)
y3 <- DGEList(counts = count3, lib.size = libSize3, remove.zeros = FALSE)

# calculate normalisation factors
y1 <- calcNormFactors(object = y1, method = "TMM")
y3 <- calcNormFactors(object = y3, method = "TMM")

# construct design matrix
sample_M <- colData(tseM)
designM <- model.matrix(~ subject + group, data = sample_M)

# estimate dispersion
y1 <- estimateGLMRobustDisp(y1, design = designM)
y3 <- estimateGLMRobustDisp(y3, design = designM)

# fit the negative binomial GLMs
fit1 <- glmFit(y1, design = designM)
fit3 <- glmFit(y3, design = designM)

# run likelihood ratio tests 
# using different contrasts
lrt1.1 <- glmLRT(fit1, contrast = NULL)
lrt1.2 <- glmLRT(fit1, contrast = c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0))

lrt3.1 <- glmLRT(fit3, contrast = NULL)
lrt3.2 <- glmLRT(fit3, contrast = c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0))

# Use Benjamin-Hochberg method to do multiple testing correction
# n is set to Inf below, because we want to have the results of all entities.
out1.1 <- topTags(lrt1.1, n = Inf, adjust.method = "BH")$table
out1.2 <- topTags(lrt1.2, n = Inf, adjust.method = "BH")$table

out3.1 <- topTags(lrt3.1, n = Inf, adjust.method = "BH")$table
out3.2 <- topTags(lrt3.2, n = Inf, adjust.method = "BH")$table
```

To write the results back to *tseM*, we could use the function `updateTSE`.
```{r}
# put the contrasts used as a list and name the contrasts
contrastList <- list(contrast1 = NULL, contrast2 = c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0))

# put the results obtained as a list
resultList <- list(assay1 = list(contrast1 = out1.1, contrast2 = out1.2), 
                   assay3 = list(contrast1 = out3.1, contrast2 = out3.2))

# write the result back to the tseM
new_tseM2 <- updateTSE(result = resultList, tse = tseM, use.assays = c(1, 3),
                      design = designM, contrast = contrastList, 
                      fit = list(fit1, fit3))
```
Create a list to store the contrasts used in the analysis and name each
contrast. The results are also organized into a list with the following
requirements.

* Results from the same assay table with different contrasts are stored in a
list. They are named according to their contrasts as *contrastList*. 
* Results from different assay tables are further organized in a list. They are
named with the `assay` followed by the number that the table is in the `assays`
of *tseM*

The output *out* has five columns, one of which is the nominal p-value
(*PValue*) and one is the adjusted p-value named *FDR*. These columns are
required by the tree aggregation step. If users choose other softwares to do
analysis, we expect they could finally get results similar to *out* with columns
containing nominal and adjusted p-values and each row representing a node of the
tree structure. We could further store the result in the `rowData` of *tse* via
the function `updateTSE`.

```{r}
all.equal(new_tseM, new_tseM2)
```

# Tree aggregation {#aggregation}

The tree aggregation could be done in one step by using the function `treeAGG`.
```{r}
aggR <- treeAGG(data = new_tseM, sigf.by = "FDR", 
                sigf.limit = 0.05, agg.by = "FDR", 
                message = TRUE)
```
Feed the argument `data` with the output from the previous analysis section
*new_tse*. The column used for tree aggregation is specified by the column name
via `agg.by`, and the column storing the adjusted p-value by `sigf.by`. Users
could decide the threshold value for the column `sigf.by` via `sigf.limit`. If
the aggregation takes time, we could set `message = TRUE` to see the running
process. With `topNodes`, the result table from the DA analysis and tree
aggregation step could be printed out. The output *aggR* from previous step is
assigned to `data`. The argument `use.assays = 1` is to show only results
obtained from the first table stored in `assays`. We could further specify how
the rows should be ordered via `sort.by` and `decreasing`. If some columns in
`linkData` or `rowData` are also needed, they could be extracted out
simutaneously via `col.rowData` and `col.linkData`, respectively.

```{r}
tabL <- topNodes(data = aggR, sort.by = "FDR", decreasing = FALSE,
                 use.assays = 1, col.rowData = NULL, 
                 col.linkData = "nodeNum")
```
Here, *tabL* is simply a list and users could extract any subelements by the
operations on the `list` class. Below, we will display the result gained with
the contrast NULL.
```{r}
tabR <- tabL$result_assay1$contrast1
```
The tree aggregation adds a column named *aggKeep* to each result table. This
column includes values `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Those rows with value `TRUE`
correspond to nodes that are finally selected as the estimated optimal level to
interpret the differential abundance pattern on the tree.

# Result visualisation

The information of true differential abundance is stored in the column *truth*
of the `rowData`. We subset the `treeSummarizedExperiment` object *aggR* to keep
only clusters that are truly differentially abundant between patient and CN
samples, and then use the function `signalNode` to find nodes that could
describe the differential abundance pattern of the tree using as few nodes as
possible while avoiding false discoveries. In other words, `signalNode` gives
the optimal level to interpret the differential abundance pattern.
```{r}
# Nodes that are truely differentially abundant
diffR <- aggR[rowData(aggR)$truth %in% TRUE, ]
# True signal (the optimal level to describe the differential abundant pattern
# in the tree)
trueLoc <- signalNode(tree = treeData(diffR), node = linkData(diffR)$nodeNum)
```

The estimated optimal level to interpret the differential abundance pattern from
`r Biocpkg("treeAGG")` is as below. Here, we extract the node number (`nodeNum`)
instead of the node label because, depends on how people generate the tree,
internal nodes might not have labels assigned to them in some trees.
```{r}
# Nodes that are estimated to be differentially abundant
estLoc <- tabR$nodeNum[tabR$aggKeep]
```
If users are interested to the node label instead of the node number,
`transNode` available in our package could simply do the transformaton between
the two. Check the example in the help page `?transNode` to see more details.

```{r}
# transform the node number to node label
# NA obtained, because in the tree structure, no label is assigned for this internal node.
transNode(tree = treeData(aggR), input = estLoc, use.alias = FALSE)
```

To compare the estimated results with the truth, we use `treePlot` to generate a
tree figure. The function `treePlot` is created based on 
`r Biocpkg("ggtree")`[@Yu2017] and `r CRANpkg("ggplot2")`[@Wickham2016]. The
branches with blue edges are truly differentially abundant. The results obtained
from the minP aggregation algorithm implemented in `r Biocpkg("treeAGG")` are
shown as orange points. Nodes labelled with orange points are the suggested as
the optimal level at which to interpret the signal.
```{r fig.height= 2}
p <- treePlot(tree = treeData(diffR) ,  
              branch = trueLoc,
              point = estLoc,
              zoomNode = c(trueLoc, estLoc),
              layout = "circular")
p
```
