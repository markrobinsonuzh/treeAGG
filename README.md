The arrangement of hypotheses in a hierarchical structure appears in many research fields and often indicates different resolutions at which data can be viewed. On which resolution level should the signal be intepreted has arisen researchers' interest. A flexible method to select resolution level, instead of cutting the tree structure at arbitary levels, is desired. Our package `treeAGG`, which uses minP algorithm, is a such tool. It does a bottom-up search for the optimal level of a tree to interpret signal by combining with current available tools, such as `edgeR` or `DESeq2`.
