\title{Select branches}
\usage{
.pickLoc(tree = NULL, data = NULL, from.A = NULL, minTip.A = 0,
  maxTip.A = Inf, minTip.B = 0, maxTip.B = Inf, minPr.A = 0,
  maxPr.A = 1, ratio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object}

\item{data}{A count table (a matrix or a data frame). It has tree leaves in
rows and samples from different conditions in columns.}

\item{from.A}{The branch node label of branch A. In simulation, we select two
branches (A & B) to have differential abundance under different conditions.
If from.A is specified, then branch A is fixed. If from.A is NULL, one can
find a suitable branch which meets the criteria specified in \code{minTip.A},
\code{maxTip.A}, \code{minPr.A} and \code{maxPr.A}.}

\item{minTip.A}{The minimum number of leaves in branch A}

\item{maxTip.A}{The maximum number of leaves in branch A}

\item{minTip.B}{The minimum number of leaves in branch B}

\item{maxTip.B}{The maximum number of leaves in branch B}

\item{minPr.A}{The minimum abundance proportion of leaves in branch A}

\item{maxPr.A}{The maximum abundance proportion of leaves in branch A}

\item{ratio}{The proportion ratio of branch B to branch A. This value is
used to select branches(see \bold{Details}). If there are no branches having
exactly this ratio, the pair with the value closest to \code{ratio} would
be selected.}
}
\value{
a data frame of one row
}
\description{
\code{.pickLoc} selects two branches which meet the criteria specified by
the arguments
