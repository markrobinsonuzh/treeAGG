\title{An S4 class leafSummarizedExperiment}
\description{
The class \strong{leafSummarizedExperiment} is an extension class of standard
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment-class}}
class. It is designed to store rectangular data like a \code{matrix} for
entities (e.g., microbes or cell types), and the information of the
hiearchical structure of entities. The annotations on the rows and columns of
the rectangular data are strored in \code{rowData} and \code{colData},
respectively. Each row of the rectangular data could be mapped to a leaf node
of the tree via the rownames of \code{rowData} or a column named as
\code{nodeLab} in \code{rowData}. For example, the abundance count of
microbes collected from different samples could be stored in the
\code{assays} and the phylogenetic tree of the microbes in the
\code{metadata}. Each row of matrix-like data in \code{assays} represents one
microbial specie that could be mapped to a leaf node of the phylogenetic
tree. The link between the row and the node could be given via a column
(\code{nodeLab}), or the rownames of \code{rowData}. Each column of the
matrix-like data is a sample. The sample information is given in the
\code{colData}. The class \strong{leafSummarizedExperiment} has four slots
\code{assays}, \code{rowData} \code{colData} and \code{metadata} as the
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment-class}}
class. More details about these four slots could be found in
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment-class}}.
}
\details{
The \strong{leafSummarizedExperiment} class has more restrictions in data
structure than the \strong{SummarizedExperiment} class. In
\strong{leafSummarizedExperiment} class, it's required that
\itemize{
\item A \code{phylo} object is stored in \code{metadata} and named as
\code{tree}. The \code{phylo} object has a unique label for each leaf node.
\item Each rows of matrix-like data in \code{assays} could be mapped to a
leaf node of the tree. The label of leaf node is provided as the column
\code{nodeLab} in \code{rowData}, or as the rownames of \code{rowData} or
\code{assays}. If both provided, the information in column \code{nodeLab} is
used. }
