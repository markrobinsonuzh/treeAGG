\title{Generate the fold change}
\usage{
doFC(tree = NULL, data = NULL, scenario = "S1", branchA = NULL,
  branchB = NULL, ratio = 1, adjB = NULL, pct = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object}

\item{data}{The real data (count table)}

\item{scenario}{Scenarios (\dQuote{S1}, \dQuote{S2}, \dQuote{S3})}

\item{branchA}{The branch node label of branch A.}

\item{branchB}{The branh node label of branch B.}

\item{ratio}{The proportion ratio between \code{branchB} and \code{branchA}
(B/A)}

\item{adjB}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 (only for \code{scenario}
is \dQuote{S3}). Default is NULL. If NULL, branch A and branch B swap their
proportions. If a numeric value, e.g. 0.1, then branch B decreases to its
one tenth proportion and the decrease in branch B is added to branch A.
For example, assume there are two experimental conditions (C1 & C2), branch
A has 10 and branch B has 40 in C1. If adjB is set to 0.1, then in C2 branch
B becomes 4 and branch A 46 so that the total proportion stays the same.}

\item{pct}{The percentage (in number) of the leaves in branchA that will
swap with branchB. The default is 1.}
