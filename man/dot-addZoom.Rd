\title{Visualize the phylogenetic tree}
\usage{
.addZoom(tree, zoomNode = NULL, zoomLevel = NULL, zoomScale = NULL,
  addTo = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object}

\item{zoomNode}{A vector of nodes to be zoomed in. If default (NULL), the
tree is not zoomed in.}

\item{zoomLevel}{A numeric vector. Its length is equal to 1 or equal to the
length of \strong{zoomNode}. If default (NULL), a leaf is zoomed in its
direct parent level and an internal node is zoomed in its own level.}

\item{zoomScale}{A numeric vector. Its length is equal to one or equal to the
length of \strong{zoomNode}. If \strong{zoomScale} has the same length as
\strong{zoomNode}, the branches are zoomed in with different scales
corresponding to the value of \strong{zoomScale}. If default (NULL), tree
is not zoomed in.}

\item{addTo}{NULL or a plot of a phylo object.}

\item{...}{see also \code{\link[ggtree]{ggtree}}}

\value{
A figure
