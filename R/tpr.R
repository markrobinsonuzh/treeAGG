#' Calculate true positive rate (TPR) on a tree structure
#'
#' \code{tpr} calculates the true positive rate (TPR) on a tree structure at
#' leaf or node level.
#'
#' @param tree A phylo object
#' @param truth Nodes that have signals (eg. differentally abundant at different
#'   experimental conditions.). If the signals are in different directions (up
#'   and down), then provide the nodes as a list of two members (one up and one
#'   down). One could provide either node number or node label. \strong{Note:}
#'   When TPR at node level is required and only leaf nodes with signal are
#'   provided, then the internal nodes which are shared and only shared by the
#'   provied leaf nodes (signal in the same direction) will be found out and
#'   used with the leaf nodes in the TPR calculation; when TPR at leaf level is
#'   required and the given nodes have internal nodes, then the descendant leaf
#'   nodes will be found out and used in the TPR calculation.
#' @param found Nodes that have been found to have signal (eg. differentally
#'   abundant at different experimental conditions). If the signals are in
#'   different directions (up and down), then provide the nodes as a list of two
#'   members (one up and one down). One could provide either node number or node
#'   label. \strong{Note:} When TPR at node level is required, then the
#'   descendant nodes of the provied nodes (include themselves) will be found
#'   out and used in the TPR calculation; when TPR at leaf level is required,
#'   then the descendant leaf nodes will be found out and used in the TPR
#'   calculation.
#' @param only.Tip A logical value, TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, true positive rate
#'   is calculated at the leaf (tip) level; otherwise it is calculated at node
#'   level. The default is TRUE
#' @param direction TRUE or FALSE. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, the signal
#'   direction is taken into account; the argument \strong{truth} and
#'   \strong{found} should both be a list of two members and the order of
#'   directions should match.
